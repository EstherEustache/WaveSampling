Description: Spatial data are generally autocorrelated, meaning that if two 
  units selected are close to each other, then it is likely that they share the
  same properties. For this reason, when sampling in the population it is often
  needed that the sample is well spread over space. We propose here a new way
  of estimating a sample from a population with spatial coordinates.
  This method is called wave (weakly associated vectors). It uses the 
  less correlated vector to a spatial weights matrix W to
  update the inclusion probabilities vector into a sample s.
